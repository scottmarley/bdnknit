***README for bdnknit_v0.2h***

ROOT macro that will take the ASCII formatted output files of SIMION, a GEANT4 simulation, and Master event file and output a ROOT file containing one TTree object filled with simulation data...

  For the moment the information file will be read into a third branch

  TTree
  |---> Branch (MASTER DECAY DATA)
  |---> Branch (SIMION DATA)
  |---> Branch (GEANT4 DATA)

It is written to be loaded as a shared library in a ROOT CINT session via the command:

.L bdn_knit_v0.2h+
